# Perceptron
Basic Perceptron model in C

# Perceptron Adder
"The adder example demonstrates how a network of perceptrons can be used to simulate a circuit containing many NAND gates. And because NAND gates are universal for computation, it follows that perceptrons are also universal for computation."
